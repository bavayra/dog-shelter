        {' '}
        Rotvodom was founded in 2010 by Rotvomama, who started building a
        shelter in her own backyard by herself. She started taking in one dog
        after another, relying solely on herself and her few friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        {' '}
        Soon enough the shelter grew, and today we are a team of dedicated
        volunteers and professionals who work tirelessly to rescue,
        rehabilitate, and rehome dogs in need. Over the years, we have saved
        hundreds of dogs from dire situations, providing them with medical care,
        behavioral rehabilitation, and most importantly, love and attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        {' '}
        Our mission is to give every dog a second chance at life and to find
        them loving forever homes. We believe that every dog deserves a chance
        to be happy, healthy, and loved, regardless of their background or
        circumstances.{' '}
